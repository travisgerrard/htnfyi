# A Strategy for Setting Goals to Improve your Blood Sugar Control

Lifestyle choices such as food preferences and exercise habits affect blood pressure control and, over time, the potential for the long-term complications of hypertension. Changing lifelong ways is very hard! The good news is small changes in everyday living can lead to big improvement in hypertension management.

One strategy to consider that many people have found helpful is setting SMART goals. Using the SMART goal framework helps people focus on specific small achievable changes.

> The SMART acronym stands for:
>
> - **S**: Specific
> - **M**: Measurable
> - **A**: Achievable
> - **R**: Realistic
> - **T**: Timely

As an example, many people would like to exercise more. If a person has not exercised routinely for a while, walking is a good start. An example of setting SMART goals for daily walking may be:

- **Specific**: I will walk around the block every day when I get home from work. On the weekends, I will walk after my morning coffee.
- **Measurable**: I will set a reminder on my phone to ping me at the same time every day and I will check off completion of the walk on my calendar.
- **Achievable**: Before I start walking every day, I will choose sturdy footwear and rain gear so that I am ready to walk whatever the weather.
- **Relevant**: I would like to get back into shape so that I feel better and burn a few calories. My doctor told me that I need to lose some weight and improve my blood sugar numbers.
- **Timely**: I really want to live my best life possible and be here for my family.

> People who report the best success using SMART goals is to write your goals down and share with family or friends. Remember start small and celebrate your wins!
