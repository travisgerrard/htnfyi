# Testing blood pressure using a blood pressure cuff

<img src={usingSphygmomanometer01} />

The most common method of testing blood pressure is using a sphygmomanometer, otherwise known as a blood pressure cuff.

A blood pressure cuff usually comes in two types, a manual cuff which is most common at the doctors office, and a digital cuff, which is more common for home measurement.

The cuff is normally placed around the upper arm, at similar hight as the heart, while seated with arm supported. The cuff is then inflated until blood flow cannot be measured through the cuff. The first point at where flow can be detected is the systolic blood pressure. The cuff is then deflated until flow can again no longer be detected. This point is the diastolic blood pressure.

Your health care provider will often want you to bring your blood pressure cuff into the office in order to ensure it is properly calibrated.

The AHA has a great inforgraphic with resources regarding monitoring your blood pressure. [These can be found here](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings/monitoring-your-blood-pressure-at-home)
