# DASH Diet

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, or DASH diet for short is the most well studied dietary methods to reduce blood pressure. The DASH diet was first studied in the late 1990s. It found that in people who had hypertension who followed the DASH diet could reduce their systolic blood pressures by **11 mm Hg**. The DASH diet is no a rigid recommendation of meals, but is instead a general plan to set you in the right direction.

The NIH has a website built around the DASH diet if you are looking for additional information: https://healthyeating.nhlbi.nih.gov
