Several different medications in this class, including

**Works by** blocking an enzyme (a tiny worker inside our bodies) that helps convert a chemical called angiotensin I into angiotensin II. This reduces the amount of angiotensin II, which is a substance that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to higher blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also increase the level of a molecule called bradykinin, which helps to relax blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.
