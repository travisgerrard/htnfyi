# Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ACEi)

**Does effect electrolytes.**

Several different medications in this class, including

> - Lisinopril
> - Benazepril
> - Ramipril
> - Enalapril

**Works by** blocking an enzyme (a tiny worker inside our bodies) that helps convert a chemical called angiotensin I into angiotensin II. This reduces the amount of angiotensin II, which is a substance that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to higher blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also increase the level of a molecule called bradykinin, which helps to relax blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.

**Pros**

> - Convenient dosing

**Cons**

> - Can cause cough
> - Can lead to a high potassium level
> - Sometimes can lead to apperance of kidney impairment
