**Works by** blocking the activation of angiotensin II AT1 receptors. AT1 receptors are found in smooth muscle cells of vessels, cortical cells of the adrenal gland, and adrenergic nerve synapses. Blockage of AT1 receptors directly causes vasodilation (Vasodilation is when the blood vessels in your body get wider. This helps your blood flow more easily, so your body can get the oxygen and other important things it needs to stay healthy.), reduces secretion of vasopressin (Vasopressin is a hormone that helps your body keep the right amount of water. It helps the body stay hydrated by controlling how much water is in your bloodstream. It also helps your body regulate the amount of salt and other materials.), and reduces production and secretion of aldosterone (Aldosterone is a hormone that helps regulate the balance of water and salt in your body. It is produced in the adrenal glands, which are two small glands that sit on top of each of your kidneys. Aldosterone helps your body know when it needs to hold on to water or let it go.), among other actions. The combined effect reduces blood pressure.
