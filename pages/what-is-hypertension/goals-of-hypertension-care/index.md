![](/01_06_01.png)

The goal of care in treatment of hypertension is to achieve and
maintain an ideal blood pressure, healthy fat levels of the blood
(lipids / cholesterol), and blood sugar control to prevent or delay problems from
hypertension.

Some persons can manage their blood pressure by eating well and
exercising regularly. Losing excess weight and taking care of yourself
by following a self-management plan will help a person achieve blood
pressure control.

> The goal for the blood pressure is to be at or below 120 / 80

For most patients, the blood pressure goal is at or under 120/80. Once under control you should have at least yearly blood pressure checks.

If your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 naturally this is usually a healthy sign.

If you take medication and have a blood pressure under 120/80 and are having symptoms of low blood pressure, most commonly lightheadedness or passing out, you should talk to your doctor.

> Depending on your age and other medical conditions, your provider may set an alternative blood pressure goal.

Some patients need medication to manage their blood pressure.

Your provider may prescribe oral medications to keep
your blood presure at the target levels.

Goals for lipid management will be defined by your provider based on
your overall health, age and goals of care.
