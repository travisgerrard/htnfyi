# Understanding Hypertension

Hypertension is a general term for when either your low (diastolic) number, high (systolic) number, or both recorded numbers in your blood pressure measurement are above what is accepted as the normal, healthy range.

As stated in the previous section, blood pressure results from both the hearts rate and amount of blood that is being pumped with each beat, as well as the overall size of the piping that the blood needs to flow through.

There are two types of hypertension, primary and secondary
- The predominant type of hypertension is primary hypertension, meaning there is no specific identifiable cause of your elevated blood pressure.

  - This educational application will focus predominantly on primary hypertension, also known as essential hypertension, and will simply be referred to from now on as hypertention

It is important to note that blood pressure is vital to survival and has various ways in which it is regulated on a second by second basis. Blood pressure varies quite a bit throughout the day, and our body is built for these fluctuations.
- When you are are exercising you need a high blood pressure to ensure rapid delivery of fuel to your muscles.
  - As such your heart will beat faster, and your blood vessels will shrink in size, reducing the over size of your bodies piping, thereby increasing blood pressure

- When you are stressed, your body assumes an automatic "fight or flight" response. As such your body will raise its blood pressure in a similar manner as with exercise, in order to ensure you have adequate nutrient supply in case you need to fight, or flee.

If you are diagnosed with hypertension, this is a reflection of you having a high blood pressure even when you are in your most rested state.

As just stated, the specific reason you may develop hypertension is not well understood. That being said, there is, luckily, some understanding of the underlying causes of hypertension.

Chronic stress: As just discussed, when under stress we assume the "fight or flight" response. Some people experience stress for years on end. This leads to your blood vessels muscles always being tense. Just as if you work out your arms your muscles grow, this non-stop working out of blood vessels can lead to their growth, reducing the overall area for blood to flow, leading to high blood pressure.

Hormones: Our body has a powerful blood pressure regulatory system known as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, or RAAS. The name is not overly important here, but this system, when activated results in blood vessels squeezing, lowering overall area for blood to flow, while at the same time increasing the total amount of blood in our blood vessels. If you are thinking less area for blood to be in while increasing the amount of blood, that sounds like a recipe for higher blood pressure, you would be right.

Sodium/Potassium imbalance: Sodium and potassium are two substances in the human body, and are known as electrolytes. The most well known source of sodium is salt that we eat. There is evidence that having a high ratio of sodium to potassium within our bodies leads to our blood vessels squeezing down. As you will see, reducing sodium


Wow, that was a lot. -->
