> - Hypertension can damage the small blood vessels in the kidney.
> - Over time the damaged kidneys are unable to filter the blood of excess fluid and waste from the body.
> - Chronic kidney disease if left untreated can get worse over time and progress to kidney failure.
> - When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary for life.
> - Chronic kidney disease can contribute to the development of heart disease or stroke.
> - Not all patients with chronic kidney disease develop kidney failure.
> - Blood pressure and blood sugar control can help prevent the development of chronic kidney disease.

> - Hypertension can cause increased deposits of fats or blood clots in the blood vessel walls. Blood clots or deposits can reduce blood flow or completely cut off blood flow to the brain or heart.
> - Brain and heart function depend on receiving oxygen flow from the blood.
> - By following a heart healthy diet, avoiding all tobacco, exercising and taking all your medications as prescribed, you may prevent stroke or heart attack.
> - Call 911 for any symptoms of stroke or heart attack.
