# Understanding Blood Pressure

To understand hypertension, one first needs to understand blood pressure.

Your body has a series of pipes within it to move blood around, these are called blood vessels.

Blood pressure is a measurement of the pressure that our blood is producing against the walls of our blood vessels and heart.

Blood pressure is generated by two main factors

1. Your heart beating, taking into acount both how fast it beats and how much blood it pumps with each beat.

2. The overall size of the vessels that blood is flowing through. The smaller the overall size as a whole, the higher the blood pressure. The walls of our blood vessles are a type of muscle. Just as you can tense your arm, your body can tense your blood vessles, reducing their overall size.

When blood pressure is measured there are two number that are recorded, a high number and a low number.

 When a heart squeezes the blood out of it and into our blood vessels, that is what the high number of your blood pressure records.
 - This is known as the **systolic** blood pressure. You can think of is as a measure of the work your heart needs to do to keep you alive.

After your heart beats, it relaxes and sucks in new blood, getting ready to pump again. Right before your heart beats, this is what the low number of your blood pressure records.
- This is known as the **diastolic** blood pressure. You can think of it as a measure of your hearts ability to relax.
